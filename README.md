# Social Network API

  ## Description
  
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <br>
  
  This is a NoSQL Social Network API using MongoDB.  Social Networks tend to store lots of information regarding users, thoughts(posts), and reactions to those posts.  Sometimes the information added needs to be changed or deleted. With this API, requests can be sent to GET all users, GET a single user, PUT (update) a single user, POST (add) a user, DELETE a user, POST (add) a friend on a user, DELETE a friend on a user, GET all thoughts, GET a single thought, PUT (update) a single thought, POST (add) a thought, DELETE a thought, POST (add) a reaction to a thought, and DELETE a reaction to a thought.  As friends and reactions are added, there is a counter to indicate how many friends they have and how many reactions they have on a single thought.

  Note: this site is not deployed, but a video demonstrating the API on Insomnia can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRuxsxpm9_SxgTHLdKHiSNT1XZ53rjUQ/view).
